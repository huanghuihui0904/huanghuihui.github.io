My research interests are mainly in software engineering. I am excited to improve software systems’ reliability and scalability. Currently I have been exposed in research areas about **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis),**Binary Similarity Detection**, **Binary File Diffing Problem**, and would like to explore new topics related to them.
